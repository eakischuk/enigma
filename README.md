#### Enigma Self Assessment
* ### Functionality
  - Meets Expectations
    - Enigma class methods encrypt and decrypt are functional and follow interaction pattern
    - encrypt and decrypt runner files function in command line i/o
* ### Object Oriented Programming
  - Above Expectations
    - Classes have defined functionality and background functionality is
    abstracted away using smaller classes and the Cipherable module
    - Law of demeter is not broken
* ### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  - Meets Expectations
    - Classes, module, method, variable, and file names follow convention
    - Multiple enumerables used, use of each is minimal
    - Hashes are used throughout to maintain pairing of letters and their shifts
* ### Test Driven Development
  - Meets Expectations
    - SimpleCov reports 100% coverage
    - Most methods are broken into helpers with helpers explicitly tested
    - Tests were written prior to methods and informed the code
* ### Version Control
  - 50 commits
  - Used branching for extensive refactor of classes to protect functionality
